## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm 8+
- Rust and Cargo
- Solana CLI tools
- Anchor CLI

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blockchain-hq/solana-voting-dapp.git
   cd solana-voting-dapp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Setup Solana CLI (if not already done)**

   ```bash
   # Install Solana CLI
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.4/install)"

   # Set to devnet
   solana config set --url devnet

   # Create a keypair (or use existing)
   solana-keygen new

   # Airdrop some SOL for testing
   solana airdrop 2
   ```

4. **Install Anchor CLI**
   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor anchor-cli --locked
   ```

### Development

1. **Build the Anchor program**

   ```bash
   pnpm anchor:build
   ```

2. **Deploy to devnet (optional - already deployed)**

   ```bash
   pnpm anchor:deploy
   ```

3. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   pnpm anchor:test
   ```

4. **Start the web application**

   ```bash
   pnpm web:dev
   ```

5. **Start the Solana Actions API server (optional)**

   ```bash
   pnpm actions:dev
   ```

   The API server will run on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

6. **Visit the application**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Poll

1. Connect your Solana wallet
2. Navigate to the voting section
3. Click "Create New Poll"
4. Fill in poll details:
   - Poll name (max 32 characters)
   - Description (max 280 characters)
   - Start time (must be in the future)
   - End time (must be after start time)
5. Submit the transaction

### Adding Candidates

1. As the poll creator, find your poll
2. Click "Add Candidate"
3. Enter candidate details:
   - Name (max 32 characters)
   - Description (max 280 characters)
4. Submit the transaction
5. Repeat for additional candidates

**Note**: Candidates can only be added before the poll starts.

### Voting

1. Connect your wallet
2. Find an active poll (started but not ended)
3. Review candidates
4. Click "Vote" on your preferred candidate
5. Confirm the transaction

**Note**: Each wallet can only vote once per poll.

### Viewing Results

- Results are displayed in real-time
- Vote counts are updated after each vote
- Results remain visible even after polls end

### Using Solana Actions (Blinks)

Solana Actions enable users to vote directly from social media platforms without leaving their feed:

1. **Generate a Blink URL**:
   - Format: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/voting/{cluster}/{pollId}`
   - Example: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/voting/devnet/1`

2. **Share on Social Media**:
   - Post the Blink URL on Twitter, Discord, or any platform that supports Solana Actions
   - Users will see an interactive voting card with all candidates

3. **Vote with One Click**:
   - Users click on their preferred candidate
   - Their wallet prompts them to sign the transaction
   - Vote is recorded on-chain instantly

**Note**: The Actions API server must be running and publicly accessible for Blinks to work.

## Smart Contract Details

### Program Instructions

- `initialize_poll_counter()`: Initialize the global poll counter (one-time setup)
- `initialize_poll()`: Create a new poll
- `initialize_candidate()`: Add a candidate to a poll
- `vote_for_candidate()`: Cast a vote for a candidate
- `close_poll()`: Close a poll (24 hours after end time)

### Account Types

- **Poll**: Stores poll metadata and timing
- **Candidate**: Stores candidate info and vote count
- **Vote**: Records individual votes (prevents double voting)
- **PollCounter**: Global counter for poll IDs

### Security Features

- **Authorization**: Only poll creators can add candidates
- **Timing Validation**: Polls must start in future, end after start
- **Vote Prevention**: One vote per wallet per poll
- **Input Validation**: String length limits and required fields

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run only Anchor program tests
pnpm anchor:test

# Run web app tests (if any)
pnpm --filter web test
```

### Test Coverage

- Poll counter initialization
- Poll creation with validation
- Candidate addition
- Voting functionality
- Error handling for edge cases

## Deployment

### Smart Contract Deployment

The program is already deployed to devnet at:
`Dkx6rMoHVhkPc1zzU8u7LxNFJ4NhBj3w7fNkNUhzDZDn`

To deploy to a different network:

1. Update `Anchor.toml` with your desired cluster
2. Ensure you have SOL in your wallet for the target network
3. Run: `pnpm anchor:deploy`

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend can be deployed to any platform supporting Next.js:

```bash
# Build for production
pnpm web:build

# Start production server
pnpm web:start
```

### Actions API Deployment

The Actions API server can be deployed to any platform supporting Node.js:

```bash
# Build for production
cd apps/actions
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start
```

**Deployment Platforms:**

- Vercel (serverless)
- Railway
- Render
- Fly.io
- Any VPS with Node.js support

**Environment Considerations:**

- Ensure the server is publicly accessible for Blinks to work
- Configure CORS settings for your domain
- Consider rate limiting for production use
